# üìà Stock Price Checker

## Description

The **Stock Price Checker** is a full stack JavaScript application built with Node.js and Express that allows users to retrieve real-time stock price information for NASDAQ-listed companies. It uses a proxy API to fetch stock data without requiring an API key, making it simple and accessible for developers and users alike.

Users can also "like" a stock, with the system ensuring that only one like per IP address is counted. For privacy compliance, IP addresses are anonymized before being stored. Additionally, the app supports comparing two stocks side-by-side, displaying the relative difference in likes between them.

This project is part of the **FreeCodeCamp Information Security and Quality Assurance Certification** learning path.
